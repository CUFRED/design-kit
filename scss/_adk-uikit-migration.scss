/**
 * Overrides for Migration to Design Kit from UIKit
 *
 * This file includes fixes for classes that cause issues when UIKit and Design Kit are used together.
 *
 * PLEASE:
 * Add a comment above each class override to indicate why it's needed. 
 * This will help when we are culling these classes after we complete more of our migration to Design Kit.
