# adk

This is the basic starter project for [Foundation for Sites 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites). It includes a Sass compiler and a starter HTML file. It was made from `foundation-cli`.

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Development

```bash
cd ~/code/design-kit/adk
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file.
